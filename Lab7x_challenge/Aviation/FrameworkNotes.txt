This error message from Microsoft Visual Studio means that your project is configured to use Entity Framework, but the necessary Entity Framework runtime libraries are not included in the target framework you've selected for your project.

Let's break down what each part means:

* **"The project's target framework does not contain Entity Framework runtime assemblies."**: This is the core of the error.
    * **Target Framework:** This refers to the specific version of the .NET Framework (e.g., .NET Framework 4.8) or .NET (e.g., .NET 6.0) that your project is designed to run on. Different frameworks have different sets of available libraries and features.
    * **Entity Framework Runtime Assemblies:** These are the compiled code libraries that Entity Framework needs to function at runtime (when your application is actually running). These assemblies contain the logic for interacting with databases, managing entities, and performing LINQ to Entities queries.

* **"Please review the target framework information in the project's property page."**: This is the suggested solution. Visual Studio is telling you to check your project settings to ensure that the target framework is correctly configured and that Entity Framework is properly included for that framework.

**Why does this happen?**

This error can occur for several reasons:

* **Entity Framework Not Installed:** You might be trying to use Entity Framework features in your code, but the necessary NuGet package for Entity Framework (e.g., `EntityFramework`, `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore`) hasn't been installed in your project.
* **Incorrect Target Framework:** Your project might be targeting a very minimal framework profile that doesn't include the full Entity Framework runtime.
* **Installation Issues:** The Entity Framework NuGet package might have been installed incorrectly or become corrupted.
* **Project Configuration Errors:** There might be an issue in your project's `.csproj` file that prevents the Entity Framework assemblies from being referenced correctly for the selected target framework.

**How to fix this:**

1.  **Check the Target Framework:**
    * In **Solution Explorer**, right-click on your project.
    * Select **Properties**.
    * Go to the **Application** tab (or **Project** tab depending on the project type).
    * Look for the **Target framework** dropdown. Ensure it's a framework version that supports the version of Entity Framework you intend to use. Typically, newer versions of .NET Framework or .NET are recommended.

2.  **Install the Entity Framework NuGet Package:**
    * In Visual Studio, go to **Tools** > **NuGet Package Manager** > **Package Manager Console**.
    * Depending on whether you're using Entity Framework 6 or Entity Framework Core, run the appropriate command:
        * **Entity Framework 6:** `Install-Package EntityFramework`
        * **Entity Framework Core:** `Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` (and potentially provider-specific packages like `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer` for SQL Server).

3.  **Verify NuGet Package Installation:**
    * Go to **Tools** > **NuGet Package Manager** > **Manage NuGet Packages for Solution**.
    * In the **Installed** tab, make sure the relevant Entity Framework package is listed for your project.

4.  **Clean and Rebuild Your Project:**
    * In Visual Studio, go to **Build** > **Clean Solution**.
    * Then, go to **Build** > **Rebuild Solution**. This can sometimes resolve issues with project references.

5.  **Check Project References (Less Common for NuGet Packages):**
    * In **Solution Explorer**, expand your project and look for the **References** node (or **Dependencies** > **Assemblies** for .NET Core/.NET projects).
    * Ensure that the `EntityFramework` or `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` assemblies (and their dependencies) are listed and don't have any warning icons next to them. NuGet package management usually handles these references automatically, but it's worth a quick check.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the error by ensuring that your project's target framework is compatible with Entity Framework and that the necessary runtime assemblies are correctly included in your project.
